# README# Java Fractal Audio CompressionA hybrid Java-CUDA fractal compression framework for audio coding.This project includes the CUDA GPU computation to faster compress the audio samples to fractal code. This project introduces these features:- Ready to process by using [MAVEN](https://maven.apache.org/).- Faster encoding by CUDA devices support from [JCuda](http://www.jcuda.org/).- Easier audio data processing.- MATLAB file extension (.mat), and binary format (.bin) are supported for fractal codes.- RAW (.raw) and .WAV audio file formats are supported.- Parallel processing is supported.- Bin-tree partition is supported.- Parameterized parition is supported.- Batch processing is supported.## Getting StartedThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.**Prerequisites**Install these software for building and launching.- [Java jdk 1.8](https://www.java.com/en/download/)- [MAVEN](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) - [CUDA Toolkit 8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)The cuda toolkit maybe exclude if you don't need to process using GPU.**Installing**Install all aboved prerequisites. Then install by following steps.1. Clone the project to your local repository.```git clone https://github.com/ratthapon/java-fractal-audio-compression jfac```2. Compile the ptx files on your machine by exec these commands in cmd.```cd jfacctx-compile-script-2```3. Install the project using MAVEN.```mvn install```It will install the program if the tests are passed. You can add *-DskipTests* if you want to install without gpu support.Check the build message, it should be passed.**Alternative installation using Eclipse**1. Clone and built as above, then exec these commands.```mvn eclipse:eclipse```2. Use the Eclipse to open this project then setup the run configuration by following:- Run -> Run Configuration -> Java Application -> Main -> Project```jfac```- Run -> Run Configuration -> Java Application -> Main -> Main Class```th.ac.kmitl.it.prip.fractal.MainExecuter```- Run -> Run Configuration -> Java Application -> Arguments -> Working directory -> Other```${workspace_loc:jfac/target}```Then you can use Eclipse to execute this program.## Running the testsTest the program is built properly by using MAVEN```mvn test```## DeploymentThis project can be executed by variety of methods. You can use any one that you prefer.- Exec by using MAVEN at the cmd,```mvn ecec:exec```, after the maven built and running the process, give the parameters to cmd and double Enter to run it with given parameters.- Exec by MAVEN with a pre-descripted parameter file by following commands,```mvn ecec:exec -Dparam="path_to_param/params.txt"```- Use as a lib, please see API list. [under development]## Example ParametersEach parameter is delimited by newline.The parameter name and value are delimited by a space as follows.```    processname compress    testname actual_synth    infile test-classes//synth-file-list.txt    inpathprefix test-classes//expected//synth_wav//    outdir test-classes//    maxprocess 7    inext raw    outext mat    pthresh 0    reportrate 0    gpu true    coefflimit 1.2    skipifexist false    minr 4    maxr 4        ```See available parameters list [under development].## Built With- [MAVEN](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management## Fractal compressionFractal compression is a data compression algorithm. It compress the raw data into smaller "code". There are many schemes to implement this algorithm but the fractal block coding is the most popular scheme. Fractal block coding store only a self-similarity parameters of each partitioned block. It is so called fractal code. The self-similarity parameters is used to compose the original data from itself.## ContributingAll contribution are gracefully accept.## VersioningWe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
